Make is a powerful cross-platform build system that can be used to manage the build process for C++ projects. To use CMake to organize your code and generate projects for different platforms, you can follow these steps:

## Step 1: Project Structure

Organize your project structure. A typical project structure might look like this:

```
project_root/
|-- CMakeLists.txt 
|-- src/ 
|   |-- CThread.h 
|   |-- CThread.cpp 
|-- examples/ 
|   |-- main.cpp
```

## Step 2: Write CMakeLists.txt

Create a CMakeLists.txt file in the project root directory. This file will define how your project should be built.
Here is a simple example for your project:
```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.12)
project(MyThreadProject)

# Add your source files
set(SOURCES
    src/CThread.h     
    src/CThread.cpp     
    examples/main.cpp)

# Specify the include directories 
include_directories(src)

# Platform-specific settings 
if(WIN32)     
    # Windows-specific settings     
    add_definitions(-DWIN32) 
else()     
    # Linux-specific settings     
    add_definitions(-DLINUX)     
    find_package(Threads REQUIRED)     
    set(EXTRA_LIBS ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}) 
endif()  

# Create the executable 
add_executable(MyThreadExample ${SOURCES})  

# Link platform-specific libraries 
target_link_libraries(MyThreadExample ${EXTRA_LIBS})
```

This CMakeLists.txt file:  
- Sets the minimum required version of CMake. 
- Defines the project and adds source files. 
- Adds platform-specific settings using conditional statements. 
- Creates an executable named MyThreadExample. 
- Links platform-specific libraries (in this case, the Threads library for Linux). 

## Step 3: Generate Project Files

Now, you can use CMake to generate project files for different platforms.  

For Unix Makefiles (Linux/macOS):
``
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake .. 
make
``

For Visual Studio (Windows):
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019"  # Use the appropriate version
```

## Step 4: Build the Project

Build the project using the generated build system.
For Unix Makefiles (Linux/macOS):
```
make
```

For Visual Studio (Windows):
Open the generated .sln file with Visual Studio and build the project.

## Step 5: Run the Executable
After building the project, you can find the executable (e.g., MyThreadExample) in the build directory and run it.
This basic example can be extended based on the specific needs and dependencies of your project. Always consult the CMake documentation for more advanced features and options.
